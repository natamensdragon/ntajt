TillyKTV's influence extends beyond her online presence. Her rise to prominence has sparked discussions about the changing landscape of online content creation and the complexities of online fandom. Her controversial approach has challenged traditional notions of beauty, sexuality, and female empowerment. Since her breakthrough exhibition, TillyKTV has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. TillyKTV has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
